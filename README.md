# Day-to-Day-Scripts
A (limited) collection of small day to day scripts

## [aber-su-log-volunteer-hours](/aber-su-log-volunteer-hours)
A small Python script to provide an automated solution to logging volunteer hours to the Aberystwyth University Student's Union system. 

Activities are defined in a CSV file and the program automatically submits these using the submission form.

Submitted hours are placed in a separate file for logging and the original file is overwritten. Spam prevention is integrated into the project through program pausing for a randomised user-defined time in seconds between form submissions.

## [hours-minutes-sum](/hours-minutes-sum)
A small Python script to take input of a set number of times in a HH:MM format and sums these together, outputting the resulting time. Utilised for manual time addition.
